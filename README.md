Highlights:
Business Problem
Global Electronics Retail faced critical challenges:
- Limited Visibility: No real-time dashboard for tracking KPIs across products, stores, and customer segments
- Fragmented Data: Sales, customer, product, and operational data existed in separate systems without unified analytics
- Reactive Decision-Making: Leadership lacked predictive insights, responding to problems rather than proactively addressing trends
- Operational Inefficiencies: Delivery performance and seasonal patterns were not systematically tracked

Dashboard Goal:
Create an executive-level, interactive Power BI dashboard that:
- Consolidates all business data into a single source of truth
- Provides real-time visibility into revenue, customers, products, and operations
- Enables drill-down analysis from high-level summaries to granular details
- Answers strategic business questions with data-backed insights
- Supports executive presentations and board-level communications

Key Business Questions Answered:
Q. What types of products does the company sell, and where are customers located?
Q. Are there any seasonal patterns or trends for order volume or revenue?
Q. How long is the average delivery time in days? Has that changed over time?
Q. Is there a difference in average order value (AOV) for online vs. in-store sales?
